# Frame Trail and German Parliament - Joscha

{{ video place holder }}

FrameTrail \([https://frametrail.org](https://frametrail.org)\) is an open source software that let's you experience, manage and edit interactive video directly in your web browser.

In the last months we have worked with the German Parliament to make session protocols searchable, provide time-based transcripts. analyze the video archive and provide various sets of time-based annotations \(using FrameTrail as a player component\).

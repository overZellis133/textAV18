### What is it?

It's a Chrome extension that will highlight claims in a tweet.

### Why did we develop this?

We wanted people to think twice before consuming Tweets. [Fact checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checking) is a relatively new technology that will make it easier to spot claims made by people you follow.

### Where do you see this going?

Integrating with [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/) once the API is available!

## Installation

1. git clone [https://github.com/andrewblaney/farfetchd.git](https://github.com/andrewblaney/farfetchd.git)

3. Tick the `Developer mode` checkbox
4. Delete any older versions by clicking the delete icon next to `farfetchd` in the list
5. Click `Load unpacked extension` and `Select` the project you cloned

It should then appear as an item in the list of extensions ‚Äì you're ready to go!
